A considerable portion of the initial check-in of ArcanOS is based directly
off the operating systems coursework labs of Dr. Lorenzo Alvisi
(http://userweb.cs.utexas.edu/~lorenzo/), and I owe him a debt of gratitude for
producing and distributing material to help bridge the gap between a simple
"Hello World" bootloader and a functioning kernel.  I believe Dr. Alvisi has
released his code under an MIT license, which is GPL compatible.

Some materials from the initial drop contain header files documented as under
a BSD license which may not be fully GPL-compatible.  Since the conflicting
clause under this license is related to advertising of products, I believe
that a hobby project such as ArcanOS will not produce any conflict.  I am
endeavoring to locate more GPL-compatible source for these files.

Concerned parties should contact me at roadriverrail@gmail.com

Unless explicity specified otherwise, materials in this project are copyright
J. Rhett Aultman (c) 2010 and are released under the terms of the GPL v3.
