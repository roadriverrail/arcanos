# Arcanos

A hobby operating system

This project has been moved to [my personal git host](https://git.kitaultman.com/kit/arcanos).

I cannot accept Microsoft's abuse of the open source communities that have
considered GitHub critical infrastructure for years.  Most egregious among
these abuses are the blatant plagiarism of FOSS source code to power Microsoft
Copilot, a machine learning system that effectively launders FOSS source code
for the profit of Microsoft.

I encourage my fellow FOSS developers to [give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org)
and to support the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org).
